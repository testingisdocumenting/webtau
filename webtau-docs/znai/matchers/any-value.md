# Match Every Value

Use `anyValue` matcher to match every expected value. Use it in places of complex data expectations where you need to 
provide a value but your focus is on different data. 

```tabs
Groovy: 
:include-file: org/testingisdocumenting/webtau/MatchersGroovyTest.groovy {
  surroundedBy: "any-value-table-example"
} 

Java: 
:include-file: org/testingisdocumenting/webtau/MatchersTest.java {
  surroundedBy: "any-value-table-example"
} 
```
