# Usage Scenarios

To document how to use a User Interface we often take screenshots and annotate them.
At the same time we need to make sure that the documented scenario works as advertised. 

With UI testing we can validate scenarios and at the same time capture screenshots with automatically placed annotations.

# Capturing Screenshots With Annotations

To capture screenshots use `browser.doc[.withAnnotations][.withRoot].capture`:

:include-file: doc-artifacts/snippets/doc-capture/captureBadges.groovy {title: "screenshot capture with badge annotations"}

The result of the `capture` command is two files:
* captured screenshot 
* `search.json`

:include-file: doc-artifacts/search.json {title: "search.json"}

[WebTau](https://testingisdocumenting.org/webtau) documentation site is generated using [Znai](https://github.com/testingisdocumenting/znai). 
It has `include-image` plugin that supports annotations format generated by `capture` command.

    :include-image: doc-artifacts/search.png {fit: true, annotate: true}
    
:include-image: doc-artifacts/search.png {fit: true, annotate: true}

# Badge Shortcut

Badge annotation is an easy-to-use one to tell a story. Numeric values help to bring the focus and explain a user a
sequence of events.

When annotation type is not specified, badge is used as the default.

:include-file: doc-artifacts/snippets/doc-capture/captureBadgesDefault.groovy {title: "default badge annotation type"}

# Annotation Types

:include-file: doc-artifacts/snippets/doc-capture/captureBadges.groovy {title: "badges"}
:include-image: doc-artifacts/search.png {annotate: true}

:include-file: doc-artifacts/snippets/doc-capture/captureRectangles.groovy {title: "rectangles"}
:include-image: doc-artifacts/search-rectangles.png {annotate: true}

:include-file: doc-artifacts/snippets/doc-capture/captureArrow.groovy {title: "arrow"}
:include-image: doc-artifacts/search-arrow.png {annotate: true}

# Annotation Placement

Use `above`, `below`, `toTheLeft` and `toTheRight` to put an annotation outside of element center.

:include-file: doc-artifacts/snippets/doc-capture/captureBadgesPlacement.groovy {title: "badge placement", endLine: "example-end", excludeStartEnd: true}

:include-image: doc-artifacts/search.png {annotationsPath: "doc-artifacts/search-diff-placement.json"}

# Screenshot Of A Specific Element 

Use `:identifier: withRoot {validationPath: "doc-artifacts/snippets/doc-capture/captureSpecificElement.groovy"}` 
to limit screenshot to a specific element

:include-image: doc-artifacts/search-results-area.png {annotationsPath: "doc-artifacts/search-results-area.json"}

:include-file: doc-artifacts/snippets/doc-capture/captureSpecificElement.groovy {title: "specific element"}
